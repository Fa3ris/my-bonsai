# My Bonsai Project

draws bonsais with ascii characters. 


The idea is to create recursive structures,
with rules to define when to branch out, in which direction and with which length. When the branch ends, we need to place the leaves around.

To draw line segments, I tried to use the Bresenham algorithm.
There is also a version to draw lines with width.
